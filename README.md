# ComeAndGrow
A self-hosted community-based platform meant to be free from external (political, governmental, etc.) control.

## Inspiration
I have noticed that companies are willing to sell away their users for the sake of profit and that it takes too much effort to control a whole platform for large communities, and then there's the topic about your own work and words being sold for AI training.

This platform is meant to be a mashup of Twitter-DeviantArt-Instagram-Reddit and eventually Discord but community-Driven rather than a whole product that can manage multiple communities at once.

Good luck, to me.
